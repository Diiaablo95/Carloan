## What is it?

Java program (for pc) which simulates a system handling car loans for a car renting company.

## Why did I make it?

Project for the <strong>Ingegneria del software</strong> course at <i>Universit√† di Bari(IT)</i> during academic year 2014-2015, my second year of bachelor's studies.

## About the application

Very first "big" program written in Java. Since it was aoftware engineering project, we tried to engineer as much as possible the solution, applying some of the software engineering <i>design</i> and <i>architectural</i> patterns such as: <strong>factory</strong>, <strong>abstract factory</strong>, <strong>business objects</strong>, <strong>transfer objects</strong>, <strong>DAO</strong>, <strong>front controllers</strong>, ecc...
We tried to concentrate as much as possible on program stability, handling or at least trying to handle all the possible exceptions that any component could generate. UI is horrible per se, because wasn't the main aim of the course.
